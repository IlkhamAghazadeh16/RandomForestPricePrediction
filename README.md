Hy my name is Ilkham im student at high school in Azerbaijan
It's my first serious experience in coding and posting on GitHub, somehow i've participated in open Hackathon named "Machine Learning Models in Python Hackathon" with 0 experience in ML and barely any in coding at all.
Though thankfully to ChatGPT and little logic i in comand with my friend had managed to win the competition and gained 250 USD as a reward XD
Firstly i've loaded database from kaggle 
Then i've trained simple model by using randomforest algorythm
Added some evaluations
And at the end of the day have visualized results with matplotlib
